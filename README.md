# Ready to Process BigData?

Learn how to handle large amount of BigData for Machine Learning using Python

## Getting Started

![Quote on BigData by Dan Ariely](https://scontent.fmaa1-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29025597_10156279834452053_6491808424697790464_o.png?_nc_cat=102&_nc_ht=scontent.fmaa1-4.fna&oh=45bac59d9687755dae0cd03d4139ed9d&oe=5D43E986)

This is a step by step guide with necessary codes and configurations for Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers as well as Business Analysts who are planning to mess with large amount of BigData for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Classifications, Predictions or applying Artificial Intelligence by using Python and other possible FREE resources.

### Prerequisites

Before anyone starts the war with BigData I beleive these resources and tools are required to be installed and configured properly

```
Python >= 3.x
Apache Spark >= 2.x
CSVKit >= 1.X
Google Drive (15 GB) or Mega Cloud (50 GB) Account
Google Collaboratory
```

### Installing

I am sharing my thoughts on a step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env ready

- [x] Using Google Colaboratory
- [ ] Install Apache Spark with Hadoop
- [ ] Install CSVKit for handling CSV files
- [ ] Connect with a Cloud Data Repository to access Datasets

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

```Shell
#OpenJDK Dependencies for Spark
apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null 

#Download Apache Spark
wget -q http://apache.osuosl.org/spark/spark-2.3.3/spark-2.3.3-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz 

#Apache Spark and Hadoop Unzip
tar xf spark-2.3.3-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz 

#FindSpark Install
pip install -q findspark 
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
